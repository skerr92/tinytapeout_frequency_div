# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "2x 1 to 4 Frequency Divider"      # Project title
  description:  "A simple flip-flop based frequency divider"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The Frequency Divider works by taking 4 frequencies and selecting 2 with select pins as inputs and through a flip-flop chain, divides the input into 4 frequencies. The frequency breaks down to f/2, f/4, f/8, and f/16."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "The most simple test of the frequency divider is to use the source clock on pin one, and attach an oscilloscope to the outputs and measure their frequency."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "external clock sources are necessary to test all inputs. A simple adjustable astable 555 is recommended"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     16Hz       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - clock (default f(1) input option)
    - f(1), 2 - second f(1) input option
    - f(2), 1 - default f(2) input option
    - f(2), 2 - second f(2) input option
    - f(1) select - selects which f(1) input frequency to use
    - f(2) select - selects which f(2) input frequency to use
    - none
    - none
  outputs:
    - f(1)/2 - Frequency 1 divided in half         # a description of what the outputs do
    - f(1)/4 - Frequency 1 divided in quarters
    - f(1)/8 - Frequency 1 divided in eighths
    - f(1)/16 - Frequency 1 divided into sixteenths
    - f(2)/2 - Frequency 2 divided in half         # a description of what the outputs do
    - f(2)/4 - Frequency 2 divided in quarters
    - f(2)/8 - Frequency 2 divided in eighths
    - f(2)/16 - Frequency 2 divided into sixteenths
